# Loan Eligibility Prediction


## Introduction
Loan eligibility prediction is crucial for financial institutions to make informed decisions about loan approvals. This project leverages machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Tree and Naive Bayes models, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of these predictions. By cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, the project ensures better model performance, ultimately improving the accuracy of loan approvals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about applicants' demographics, financials, and other relevant factors that determine loan eligibility. The data is cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy to ensure quality inputs for the models.

## Models Implemented
- Decision Tree: A tree-based model that splits the dataset based on the most significant features.
- Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are assessed using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- Precision: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions in all positive predictions.
- Recall: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions in all actual positive cases.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Visualizations
Visualizations were created to analyze data trends and model performance using Matplotlib.
